        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>
            On a cold night in 1982, in his secret lair in Fort Hack-tinson, Wisconsin, our founder, Robert "Bobby" Boolean, sat in the dark wearing a trench coat and sunglasses - the traditional uniform for a software developer. He found himself hungry. He had been writing code all day (in HTML of course), which was his greatest passion. He was suddenly and sharply struck with an immense urge to eat Thai food. He searched the phone book for hours, and even used smoke signals to contact the neighboring village (this was pre-internet after all), but it was all to no avail. Thai food was less common than cases of abstract equality in JavaScript. He was left with a choice; never satisfy his urge to eat Thai food, or to make the Thai food himself. He acted swiftly, creating both the internet and his famous Thai restaurant H-Thai-ML in one night. Afterwards, nothing has been the same. Much has been made of the mystery behind Bobby Boolean. How did he do it? How did he make such tasty cuisine? While the recipes are secret, the flavor is not. The Fort-Hacktinson location, now our flagship, is home to many legendary dishes, such as the HTMLaab, and Binary Panang Curry. Whether or not you are new or old to the H-Thai-ML experience, we welcome you with open source arms. Thank you for your patronage, and as always, enjoy our tasty bytes.
